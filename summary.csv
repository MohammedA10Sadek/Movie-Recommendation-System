Guardians of the Galaxy,Like a lot of other people. I wasnot sure what to expect from this movie. To say it exceeded my expectations would be an understatement. Its a clever and fresh gem in the stable of Marvel films. One of the best they ve put out so far. /nThe script is full of funny lines but its also got lots of good character stuff with earned emotional moments. The action and effects are nice. The cast is great. including those just doing voices./n Chris Pratt does a wonderful job blending the comic relief with the superhero. The soundtrack of old pop songs is terrific and integrated into the plot perfectly. The homages to Star Wars and Indiana Jones and more are fun. Which is the simplest and best word to describe this movie: fun. You'll have a blast watching it.,user2442
John Wick Chapter 4,By now you know what to expect from a John Wick movie. I thought the franchise was losing a little momentum in chapter 3 so I was worried this could be disappointing. Its not. Its even more on steroids than any Wick before! Even close to 3 hours it does not feel to long which is very special for a action movie. This franchise has set new standards. If anybody says a movie is good like John Wick. it better fn be! The set pieces as everyone mentioned before are really insane this time. The Tokyo sceney with illuminated cherry blossoms was beautiful. The only super illogical thing that bothered me was that nobody flinched at the nightclub. eventually they did but after a whole 10 minute beatdown through the whole club, but then again its a shady nightclub for high table people. If you liked the first three movies and get your ass to the cinema. Yeah.,john
Air,Really really loved this movie. I know its become a bit of an overused adage nowadays but this feels like the kind of movie we just do not get anymore. I ve missed Ben Affleck as a director so much. I ve liked every movie he is directed so far even Live By Night and this movie shows just how capable he is behind the camera. His directing is a big part of the reason why this film is as captivating as it is. He never just reverts to simple shot or reverse shot between actors during these long dialogue scenes but instead keeps the characters moving and energetic and it keeps the scenes visually interesting. Its also extremely well edited with the film being kept at a brisk pace with a runtime that feels just right for this story.,steven
Evil Dead Rise,It is so good. It checked all the necessary marks. Being a huge fan of the franchise I went in knowing what to expect. But there is something missing from this entry that becomes more evident when you try to rank all five films. I can not say its better than the previous four yet I still dont know why. I guess an apartment building cant beat the cabin or medieval times. But the humor was severely lacking and to be honest the gore wasnt as relentless and shocking as I thought it would be. It reminded me of the Hellraiser remake released by Hulu or the recent Shudder original films. The X factor is clearly missing here and it will take me some time to figure out exactly why. Its a good horror film. Its just not an awesome Evil Dead film.,ahmed
The Super Mario Bros,Mario Chris Pratt and Luigi Charlie Da are struggling Brooklyn brother plumbers. When the citys sewer goes haywire and Mario sees an opportunity for heroic fame. Instead they get sucked into an alternate world. The brothers get separated. Mario joins Princess Peach Anya Taylor-Joy to recruit the Kong army in their fight against the evil turtle Bowser Jack Black . Luigi gets captured. Its brightly colored. Its energetic. Its got the characters. There is the game play. The story is fairly simple. Its pretty much what I expected. I wish there is more heart to it. The brothers could have been that but they get separated pretty quickly. I played some of the games over the years and this will probably appeal to the fans. Its got all the brightly colored chaos for the kids. Its less so for everybody else.,James
The Shawshank Redemption,This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope. Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring and intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd .Red Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Reds group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been institutionalized. The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates and some of which deserve a second chance. Whatever you do and dont listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want.,user334
The Dark Knight,This movie is a work of art. The finest sequel ever made. I dont think we will see another movie like this for a long time. Heath Ledgers Joker is the best movie charachter I have ever seen by far. Avengers Endgame is great but The Dark Knight is much better. The best Batman ever! The best Joker ever! The best DC movie ever! The best superhero movie ever! Ando for me. the best movie ever!,littlemartinarocena
Inception,You only get to watch this for the first time once. so choose your state of mind carefully. It is a film about movies and dreams and reality and what sort of life it is best to find when you leave the cinema and return to whatever you left to enter. It is spectacular and brutal and enigmatic and disturbing. It is beautiful and absorbing. It is about one of my favourite characters ever to grace the screen. I dont see it often in case its not as good as I like to remember it. That is my secret that I lock away in my safe in the basement. That somewhere there is a perfect world for us all. For some perhaps it is in the cinema watching this.,johnnymacbest
Interstellar,A lot has been said and written about Interstellar. You can obviously take apart any movie that is out there. You will either love this one or you wont. I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen and the sheer scope of the whole thing. Its just amazing and what Nolan has put on screen here. Its not only the visual experience and there is no 3D here by the way. its the storyorride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others. where its heading no pun intended. but it doesnt change the fact that its beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time. Going out and saying this will be considered a classic and might not be too far stretched but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. Its the best possible way this could go even if its not in our grasps just yet ...,AlsExGal2
